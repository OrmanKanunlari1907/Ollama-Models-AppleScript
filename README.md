This application is for MacOS. I have only tested it on MacOS 15.4 Sequoia but it should work with any MacOS version that supports Ollama (Big Sur and later).
Prerequisites:
Ollama (obv)

You will need to download it and run it so that it is in your system path.
Bypass Gatekeeper
When your run this application for the first time MacOS will not be happy. I haven not signed this application because that costs money.
For Sonoma and older you can do the age old trick of right clicking and selecting open and it will give you a warning and then you can run it. MacOS Sequoia is extra in that you have to go into System Settings and allow it to run (super annoying btw Apple ï£¿)

The models I have setup for easy selection are Llama 3.2, Deepseek-R1:14B, and Minstral.
If you select any of these models and it is already not installed Ollama will install it for you. Just be aware that Minstral and Deepseek both take ~8 GB of harddrive space.
